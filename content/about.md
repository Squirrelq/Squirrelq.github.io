We're a 'big hazy IPA' specialty brewery based in Melbourne. We make big juicy beers because that's what we like to drink. We focus on making great tasting hazies that are soft yet bold, and a little, dare we say, 'pillowy'?

We believe that **mouthfeel is critical!**

Our name and each beer release follows an underlying theme. You may see it straight away! But if not, wait for a few more releases to get more of an idea.
