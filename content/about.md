We're a 'big hazy IPA' specialty brewery based in Melbourne. We make big juicy beers because that's what we like to drink. We focus on making great tasting hazies that are soft yet bold, and a little, dare we say, 'pillowy'?

We believe that **mouthfeel is critical!**

Our mission to brew the perfect hazy will be a long road, and potentially, one without an end. But we are dedicated to get closer and closer to haze perfection with every beer we release to you fellow haze enthusiasts. There will be ups and downs along the way as we experiment and trial new methods and recipies. Not everything will turn out the way we expect, but rest assured, you'll always be getting quality juice from Topwise Brewing.
